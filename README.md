# YU-Sync

## What you need to run this
Having Javascript, React, Typescript, Python, Git is all that is necessary.

## Cloning repo
To get this up and running, open Git Bash, and cd to the working directory you keep your files in.
Then come back to the repo, click on **code** and copy the Https url.
Then type in Git Bash: git clone <*url*>: you can paste it using **CTRL+SHIFT+V**

## Modifying repo
Upon opening the project in your IDE you will find errors all over the place,  enter the following commands in your terminal, **make sure it is in the project directory**:

**CREATE A PYTHON VIRTUAL ENV FOR THE SECOND COMMAND**
npm update
pip install -r requirements.txt

After this, you should give your IDE a moment to read and update **ALL packages** before adding any code. 

I will add any npm packages you need here to render some of the stuff:
npm i react-type-animation
npm i install react-router-dom
### File Errors
you may often find that a file shows many errors, pay *no mind* to them if they do not make the site **crash**, this is just typescript pointing out potential syntax errors.
